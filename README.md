# VQA

Visual Question Answering (VQA) System: 

Create a system where a user can upload an image and ask questions about it (e.g., "What is the color of the car?"). 

Use a combination of a computer vision model (like a pre-trained CNN) for image feature extraction and an LLM for natural language understanding and response generation.
